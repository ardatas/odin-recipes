<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kebap is a flavorful Middle Eastern dish featuring marinated meat (typically lamb or chicken) grilled to perfection and served with flatbread, fresh vegetables, and garlic sauce. The meat is seasoned with spices like cumin, paprika, and sumac, then skewered and cooked over an open flame for a smoky char. Serve it with tahini, pickles, and a squeeze of lemon for an authentic touch.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Kebap is cooked on a vertical rotisserie or grill, ensuring juicy, tender meat with crispy edges. Pro tip: Let the meat marinate overnight for maximum flavor. The result is a hearty, aromatic dish perfect for gatherings or street-food cravings!</p>
