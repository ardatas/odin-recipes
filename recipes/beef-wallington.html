    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef Wellington is a classic, elegant dish featuring a tender beef fillet wrapped in mushroom duxelles, prosciutto, and puff pastry. To prepare it, sear the fillet until browned, then coat it with a layer of finely chopped mushrooms, shallots, thyme, and a touch of mustard. Next, wrap it in thin slices of prosciutto to lock in moisture before encasing it in puff pastry and baking until golden.</p>
    <p>raditionally, Beef Wellington is baked at around 400°F (200°C) for 20–25 minutes until the pastry is crisp and the beef is medium-rare. Serve it sliced, ideally with a rich red wine or truffle sauce. Pro tip: Chill the mushroom mixture before assembling to prevent soggy pastry. The result should be juicy, flavorful beef with a crispy, flaky crust—perfect for a special occasion!</p>
